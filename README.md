This is a prototype of a major project that I am currently working on.
This project contains an implementation of a RESTful API and how we can authenticate a 
user using efficient, correct and scalable JWT authentication.
While for the security and encryption we are using hash and salt with sha256 to generate a 
hashed equivalent to our password.

While this is not the official product, but this repo would still be constantly approved in order to reach 
production grade someday and until then my whole hearted focus is on the main product which is confidential 
right now, would be revealed soon...
